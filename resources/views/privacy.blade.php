      <p>
        Munchi (“we”, “us”) operates the website and web application at <strong>munchiapp.co</strong> (the “Service”).
        This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1) Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, username (if provided), and an internal user ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and technical information:</strong> pages/screens you visit, actions you take, device and browser details, IP address, approximate location (city/country), language settings, and referrer/UTM parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> cookies/local storage for login sessions, security, preferences, and (if enabled) analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewarded offers / advertising tracking:</strong> if you choose to use rewarded offers (for example, to earn points), third-party offer providers and advertisers may collect information to track offer completion and prevent fraud. This can include device identifiers, IP address, and cookie-based identifiers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2) How we use your information</h2>

      <h2>3) Rewarded offers and third parties (AdGem)</h2>
      <p>
        Munchi may display third-party rewarded offers powered by <strong>AdGem</strong> and its advertising partners.
        If you interact with offers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may send a <strong>non-sensitive identifier</strong> such as your internal user ID (and optional tracking parameters like “subid”) to attribute rewards to your account.</li>
        <li>AdGem/advertisers may collect information needed to verify completion, detect fraud, and provide the offer experience.</li>
        <li>Each offer may be subject to the third party’s own terms and privacy policies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not control how third parties process data on their platforms. Please review their policies when you leave our Service.

        <li>With offer/advertising partners only as needed for attribution, fraud prevention, and reward verification.</li>
        <li>If required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
        <li>In connection with a business transaction (e.g., merger or acquisition), where allowed by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>
